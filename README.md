# Complex-Infections
Contains the scripts and test files for the manuscript "Detecting complex infections in Trypanosomatids using in whole genome sequencing reads"

# How to run the script:
The script *CI_Estimation_server.v.7.R* receives a VCF file that contains the read depth information for each allele in a sample, estimates the **"Complexity Index" (CI)** and classify the isolate in complex (multiclonal or poliploid) or not.

genome coverage and somy estimations of chromosomes and estimates the isolate complexity
